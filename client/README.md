# Full-Stack Search and Save

Rebuild of an existing feature in my last project: https://personal-dashboard.netlify.com/

Currently that project is a pure front-end dashboard that consumes a public API and saves the user data in local storage.

I will change it to search data from a public API and save it to mongoDB with user authentication.

## Installation
